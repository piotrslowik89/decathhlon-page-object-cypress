## Description

An example of an automated test project. Written in Cypress in Page Object Pattern.
It presents a simple journey through the decathlon.pl website.
Libraries for creating reports are implemented, e.g. mochawesome-report.

The selectors are not perfectly added, so they may become outdated if the page is modified.

I plan to continue developing it.
